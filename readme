conf.ninja is spat out as a build.ninja. Except for these cases:
The first line of a conf.ninja file may be a shebang. Defaults as python
Text between two % lines are put in a tempfile and "$shebang $tmp" is piped to build.ninja
Line beginning with ! are executed and piped to build.ninja. Useful for !cat rulefile

Simple. You can even import ninja's ninja_syntax module
